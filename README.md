# PortfolioProjects
 Welcome to my Data Science portfolio. I am a junior data scientist with 3 years of experience in learning and working with python. I am very proficient in building data applications with flask and streamlit, predictive modelling, data processing, and data mining algorithms. Capable of combining all these to translate business and functional qualifications into substantial deliverables.

 This repository holds my personal data science projects to demonstrate the general skills of a data scientist such as:
 1. Data Visualiztion using matplotlib, seaborn, plotly etc.
 2. Machine Learning using scikit-learn, keras and pytorch.
 3. Pattern Recognition
 4. Statistical Analysis
 5. Data Preparation


 The main programming language used in this repository is Python.
 Thank you for visiting.
